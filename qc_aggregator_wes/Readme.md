# QC Aggregator (DNAnexus Platform App)

Modified by Xinming Zhuo 20190130
Aggregates data produced from bcl2fastq and Picard metrics including alignment, hsmetrics, variant calling, and summary


# What are the inputs to this app?

The inputs include an `all_barcodes.html` file produced from [bcl2fastq](https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/bcl2fastq-conversion-software.html) and output files from Picard with sample patterns and extensions matching: ` [sample_name].alignment_summary_metrics`, `[sample_name]_collect_wgs_metrics.txt` `[sample_name].variant_calling_detail_metrics`, and `[sample_name].get_callrate_gender.out`. The user may choose to report metrics of interest that are identified in the input file to the output `CSV`. 

# What does this app output?

The first output file is a concatenation of all input files. In this process, the `all_barcodes.html` will be converted to text format through running [html2text](https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text). The second output file is a `CSV` file containing whether or not a metric of interest was found in the input file and its calculated value. If the metrics are total values, sums will be calculated. If the metrics are percentages, averages will be calculated. 

This is the source code for an app that runs on the DNAnexus Platform.
